%This file considers the special case of only a macro base station.
%The power minimization under QoS requirements and power constraints is
%
%minimize   total transmit power
%subject to SINR_k >= SINRconstraints(k) for all users k,
%           Power constraints.
%
%This optimization problem is convex. The computational complexity is
%therefore polynomial in the number of users, antennas, and power
%constraints. The implementation can, at least, handle 10 users, 100
%antennas, and 100 power constraints.
%
%
%INPUT:
%H               = Kr x N matrix with row index for receiver and column
%                  index transmit antennas
%SINRconstraints = Kr x 1 vector with SINR constraints for all users.
%Qsqrt           = N x N x L matrix with matrix-square roots of the L 
%                  weighting matrices for the L power constraints
%q               = Limits of the L power constraints
%
%OUTPUT:
%Wsolution     = N x Kr matrix with beamforming that solves the QoS problem. 
%                This matrix is empty if this problem isinfeasible.
