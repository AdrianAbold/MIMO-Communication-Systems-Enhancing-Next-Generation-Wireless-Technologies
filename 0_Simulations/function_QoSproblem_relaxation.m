%This file considers the general case with a macro base station and
%multiple small cells. The power minimization under QoS requirements and
%power constraints is
%
%minimize   total transmit power
%subject to SINR_k >= SINRconstraints(k) for all users k,
%           Power constraints.
%
%This optimization problem is convex. The computational complexity is
%therefore polynomial in the number of users, antennas, and power
%constraints. The implementation can, at least, handle 10 users, 100
%antennas, and 100 power constraints.

%INPUT:
%H               = Kr x N matrix with row index for receiver and column
%                  index transmit antennas. N is the total number of
%                  antennas and Kr is the number of users.
%Nantennas       = Kt x 1 vector with number of antennas at each
%                  transmitter
%SINRconstraints = Kr x 1 vector with SINR constraints for all users.
%Q               = N x N x L matrix with the L weighting matrices for the
%                  L power constraints
%q               = Limits of the L power constraints
%
%OUTPUT:
%Wsolution     = N x Kr matrix with beamforming that solves the QoS problem. 
%                This matrix is empty if this problem isinfeasible.
%transmitpower = Total transmit power at the final solution
%BSallocation  = N x Kr matrix with ones for all antennas that serve a
%                given user and zeros otherwise.
